# TODO

- [ ] Remake the graph building to stellargraph framework directly??
  - networkx is used for graph construction and node2vec, other algorithms use StellarGraph, so if we don't use node2vec, but other algorithms it would be more efficient to construct the graph as Stellargraph directly and not transform it from networkx
- [ ] metric to compare results
- [ ] other datasets than iris
- [ ] investigate GraphSAGE curved result
- [ ] new graph building functions ??? maybe
- [ ] do grid search on all combinaions of weights, builds, features, etc.
